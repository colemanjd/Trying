  <p>A few of my observations of bubbles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most are made of soap</li>
    <li>There can be many small bubble or few big bubbles</li>
    <li>Bubbles can be made naturally or mechanically </li>
    <li>Bubbles are very fragile</li>
    <li>It's hard to say bubbles aggresively</li>
  </ul>

<div class="main">
  <h2>touch</h2>

  <p>Touch is the second noun for this website. Touch is one of the five main senses. Touch is the reason we are able to feel smooth, rough, hot, cold, etc. objects.
  Touch is also the reason we feel physical pain and pleasure.

  <p> The final noun is vase. </p>
  <p> I like the word vase, it rhymes with place, and when they crack, in comes disgrace. Expensive vases always break in movies.</p>
